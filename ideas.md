# Hi World App — Design Brainstorm

Since this is a simple "Hi World" starter scaffold that will evolve based on user requirements, the design should be clean, welcoming, and ready to be extended.

## Idea 1: Warm Minimalism — "Soft Landing"

**Design Movement:** Japandi-inspired warm minimalism with organic touches.

**Core Principles:**
1. Warmth through natural tones — cream, sand, terracotta
2. Generous whitespace as a design element
3. Organic shapes softening rigid geometry
4. Typography-driven hierarchy

**Color Philosophy:** A warm neutral palette (cream `#FAF7F2`, charcoal `#2D2926`, terracotta accent `#C4654A`) that feels inviting and human, avoiding cold tech aesthetics.

**Layout Paradigm:** Full-viewport centered with asymmetric decorative elements — a single focal point with floating organic blobs in the background.

**Signature Elements:**
- Soft organic blob shapes as background decoration
- A single oversized greeting with a subtle hand-drawn underline
- Warm gradient transitions

**Interaction Philosophy:** Gentle hover states with scale and opacity shifts. Nothing jarring.

**Animation:** Slow fade-in on load (800ms), subtle floating animation on decorative elements, smooth text reveal.

**Typography System:** Display: "DM Serif Display" for the greeting. Body: "DM Sans" for supporting text. High contrast in weight between heading and body.

## Idea 2: Neo-Brutalism — "Bold Statement"

**Design Movement:** Neo-brutalist web design with playful confidence.

**Core Principles:**
1. Bold, unapologetic typography
2. Thick borders and hard shadows (no blur)
3. High-contrast color blocking
4. Raw, honest aesthetic

**Color Philosophy:** Stark white background `#FFFFFF` with jet black `#1A1A1A` text, punchy yellow accent `#FFD60A` for energy. The palette screams confidence and clarity.

**Layout Paradigm:** Off-center composition with the greeting pushed to the left third, a large colored block on the right. Deliberately breaking symmetry.

**Signature Elements:**
- Thick 3px black borders on interactive elements
- Hard drop shadows (4px offset, no blur)
- Rotated accent elements at slight angles (-2deg to 3deg)

**Interaction Philosophy:** Snappy, tactile interactions — elements shift on hover with hard shadow changes, like pressing physical buttons.

**Animation:** Quick snap animations (200ms), elements slide in from edges, rotation micro-interactions on hover.

**Typography System:** Display: "Space Grotesk" bold/black for maximum impact. Body: "Space Grotesk" regular for consistency. Mono: "JetBrains Mono" for any code-like elements.

## Idea 3: Glassmorphism Dusk — "Ethereal Glow"

**Design Movement:** Glassmorphism meets twilight gradient aesthetics.

**Core Principles:**
1. Depth through layered translucent surfaces
2. Rich gradient backgrounds evoking a dusk sky
3. Soft glow effects for emphasis
4. Floating card metaphor

**Color Philosophy:** Deep navy-to-indigo gradient background (`#0F172A` to `#312E81`), with frosted glass cards and a warm amber glow accent (`#F59E0B`). The palette feels like a calm evening sky.

**Layout Paradigm:** Centered floating glass card on a full-bleed gradient background, with subtle light orbs creating depth.

**Signature Elements:**
- Frosted glass card with backdrop-blur and subtle border
- Animated gradient orbs floating in the background
- Soft glow/halo effect around the main text

**Interaction Philosophy:** Smooth, fluid interactions — glass card subtly shifts on mouse movement (parallax), glow intensifies on hover.

**Animation:** Gradient orbs drift slowly (20s infinite), text fades in with upward motion, glass card has a gentle breathing scale animation.

**Typography System:** Display: "Outfit" semi-bold for modern elegance. Body: "Outfit" light for airy readability against dark backgrounds. White text with subtle text-shadow for glow.
