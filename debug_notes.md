# Debug Notes - RESOLVED

## Issue Status: FIXED

The editor is now rendering properly! Looking at the latest screenshot:
1. The title "Welcome to Manus Markdown Editor" is rendering as a heading
2. "A **professional**" is showing with bold text
3. "Lists and Tasks" section is showing properly
4. "Bullet List" is rendering with proper bullet points
5. The toolbar is working correctly

## What was fixed:
1. Changed the demo content from markdown to HTML format
